# employee-tracker

## Description
This is a command line interface that allows you to track employees by way of multiple tables in a database. This uses mySQL, Inquirer, and console.table. 


## Installation
- Run NPM install for mySQL, Inquirer, and console.table as the node_modules is not included/tracked. Type "npm i " in your console.
- Enter "npm db/seeds.sql" into the console to seed the database for demonstration purposes.
- Enter "npm start" into the console to begin the command line interface.

## Issues
1. Seeding the database sometimes has issues. I have to use mySQL to seed the database.  
2. Tables that are displayed need the column names changed
3. Foreign Keys need to be changed, I dont believe they are working. 
4. Table joins need to be implemented.
